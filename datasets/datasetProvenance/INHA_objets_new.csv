"141598","1","Thymiatérion étrusque","Ce thymiaterion (brûle-parfum destiné à un usage domestique et funéraire) est un assemblage d'éléments modernes et d'antiquités étrusques.Dans sa partie supérieure, un satyre s’apprêtant à assomme d'une pierre un serpent qui monte sur son bâton, surmonté d'un fût torsadé se terminant en une caryatide mi-femme mi-poisson, a été retrouvée dans les fouilles de Lucien Bonaparte à Vulci en 1828-1829. Passé par la vente Canino de 1837, l'objet a été complété lors de la vente Beugnot de 1840 par une coupelle sommitale et un socle moderne en marbre jaune de Sienne supporté par trois pieds de ciste prénestine en forme de patte de lion et décorés de scènes de lutte, plus récents que le reste de l'encensoir. Le ""Candélabre au satyre"", tel qu'il a été nommé au XIXe siècle, est aujourd'hui conservé à Compiègne au Musée Antoine Vivenel. ","Découvrez l'histoire de ce thymiatérion (brûle-parfum) qui a traversé les siècles depuis sa création en Étrurie aux 4e-3e siècles avant J.-C. jusqu'au Musée Antoine Vivenel à Compiègne (France).","La partie supérieure de ce thymiatérion (Satyre et fût torsadé surmonté d'une figure anguipède) a été découverte lors des fouilles du Prince de Canino sur le site de Vulci dans le Latium (Italie) en 1828-1829.","Après sa découverte, ce thymiatérion se retrouve dans les ventes Canino de 1837 et Beugnot de 1840, où il est acheté par Antoine Vivenel, assemblé avec d'autres éléments antiques (pieds de ciste prénestine, plateau au sommet) et modernes (socle).","Le thymiatérion, ayant appartenu à Antoine Vivenel, est conservé à Compiègne depuis 1843 au musée qui porte son nom à la suite du don de sa collection, le Musée Antoine Vivenel.","This thymiaterion (incense burner for domestic or funerary purposes) is a mix between modern and Etruscan elements. A walking satyr is about to stun a snake climbing his staff with a stone. It is topped by a spiraling shaft twisting into a fish-woman hybrid caryatid. It was found in Vulci during the 1828-1829 excavations conducted by Lucien Bonaparte. After being sold during the Canino sale in 1837, and before the Beugnot sale in 1840, two modern elements were added: a little cup on the top and a modern plinth in Sienna yellow marble on the bottom part, as a base. This base is supported by three bronze lion paws, decorated with fighting scenes, which belong probably to an ancient Praenestine cistae. This so-called ""Satyr's Candelabra"" is currently in the Antoine Vivenel Museum in Compiègne. ","Explore the history of this thymiaterion (incense burner) throughout the centuries from its creation in Etruria during the 4th-3rd c. BC until its arrival in the collection of the Antoine Vivenel Museum in Compiègne (France).","The superior part of this thymiaterion (a satyr and a spiraling shaft topped by an fish-woman caryatid figure) was found during the excavation of 1828-1829 led by the Prince of Canino on the archaeological site of Vulci, Latium, Italy. ","After its discovery, this thymiaterion was sold during the Paris auctions of Canino in 1937 and Beugnot in 1940, where it was bought by Antoine Vivenel. At this time, it was reassembled with other elements added, ancient (feet from a Praenestine cistae, cup on the top) and modern (plinth).","This thymiaterion, which belonged to Antoine Vivenel, has been kept in Compiègne since 1843, following the donation of Vivenel's collection to the museum which henceforth has been named after him, the Antoine Vivenel Museum.",,"candélabre","mobilier / instrument",,"métal","46,5 cm (hauteur)","46,5","Étrurie","Italie","42.4210287479","11.7527441248","région","4e siècle avant J.C.","-400","-300","Vulci","42.4192224","11.6286618333","ville","Italie","certain",,,,"Musée Antoine Vivenel","1843","Compiègne",,"France","49.417635","2.821754","batiment","http://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/003141598","1"

"86093","1","Psykter attique à figures rouges","Ce type de vase à la forme très particulière, un psykter, était placé dans un cratère afin de permettre de refroidir le vin avec de la glace. Sur ses parois, le dieu du vin Dionysos rencontre le héros Héraclès, au milieu d'une joyeuse troupe de satyre. Fait assez rare pour les vases grecs du marché de l'art de la première moitité du XIXe siècle, on connaît précisémment la tombe de la cité de Vulci où l'objet a été découvert en 1828, le vase étant ensuite passé dans différentes collections avant d'entrer dans les collections du musée Antoine Vivenel de Compiègne en 1843.","Découvrez l’histoire de ce vase qui a traversé les siècles depuis sa création en Attique (Grèce) au 1er quart du 5e siècle avant J.-C. jusqu’au Musée Antoine Vivenel à Compiègne en France.","Le vase a été découvert en novembre 1828 dans les fouilles du Prince de Canino à Vulci dans le Latium (Italie).","Après sa découverte, le vase se retrouve dans les ventes Canino de 1837 et Magnoncour de 1839, où il est acheté par Jean de Witte.","Le vase, ayant appartenu à Antoine Vivenel, est conservé à Compiègne depuis 1843 au musée qui porte son nom suite au don de sa collection, le Musée Antoine Vivenel.","This very peculiar vase shape, called a psykter, was filled with ice and placed into a krater to cool the wine. It depicts the god of wine Dionysus meeting the hero Herakles in the middle of an enthousiastic band of satyrs. Quite rare in the history of the Greek vases that have been sold on the Art Market during the first half of the 19th century, we precisely know the tomb of the city of Vulci where the object has been found in 1828. This vase then went through different collections before being acquired in 1843 by the Antoine Vivenel Museum in Compiègne. ","Explore the history of this vase throughout the centuries, from its creation in Attica (Greece) during the 1st quarter of the 5th c. BC until its arrival in the collection of the Antoine Vivenel Museum in Compiègne (France).","This vase was discovered in November 1828 during the Prince Canino's (Lucien Bonaparte) excavations in Vulci (Latium, Italy).","After its discovery, this vase was sold in the auctions Canino of 1937 and Magnoncour of 1839, where it was bought by Jean de Witte. ","This psykter, which belonged to Antoine Vivenel, is kept in Compiègne since 1843 following the donation of his collection to the museum which henceforth has been named after him, the Antoine Vivenel Museum.","Peintre de Cléophradès","vase","vase","Psykter","terre cuite","32,8 cm (hauteur)","32,8","Attique","Grèce","38.0519988333","23.8189911","région","1er quart du Ve siècle avant J.C.","-400","-450","Vulci","42.4192224","11.6286618333","ville","Italie","certain","Novembre 1828","1828","1828","Musée Antoine Vivenel","1843","Compiègne",,"France","49.417635","2.821754","batiment","http://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/00386093","1"

Découvert à Vulci en 1829 lors des fouilles organisées par le Prince de Canino, il fait partie des très nombreuses oeuvres achetées par James Millingen pour le British Museum lors de la vente Canino de 1837.","Découvrez l'histoire de ce lécythe qui a traversé les siècles depuis sa création en Attique (Grèce) vers 480 avant J.-C. jusqu'au British Museum à Londres au Royaume-Uni.","Ce lécythe a été découvert en mars 1829 lors des fouilles du Prince de Canino à Vulci dans le Latium (Italie).","Après sa découverte, ce lécythe se retrouve dans la vente Canino de 1837, durant laquelle elle est achetée par James Millingen pour le British Museum.","Le vase est conservé depuis 1837 au British Museum à Londres.","This lekythos (vase used for storing perfumed oil for body care) contains a depiction of a scene from the Odyssey: Odysseus, hidden under a sheep, escaping from the giant Polyphemus' lair. The scene is painted using the Six's technique, where the different colors are superimposed on black surface and the details are then incised. Discovered in Vulci in 1829 during the excavations led by the Prince of Canino, this vase is one of the numerous objects bought by James Millingen for the British Museum during the Canino sale of 1937.","Explore the history of this lekythos throughout the centuries from its creation in Attica (Greece) around 480 BC to the British Museum in London. ","This lekythos was discovered in March, 1829, during the Prince of Canino excavations in Vulci (Latium, Italy). ","After its discovery, this vase was sold in the auction Canino of 1937, when it was bought by James Millingen for the British Museum. ","Since 1937 this lekythos has been in the collection of the British Museum in London.","Peintre de Diosphos","vase","vase","Lécythe","terre cuite","15,2 cm (hauteur)","15,2","Athènes","Grèce","37.998949","23.725464","ville","Vers le 1er quart du 5e siècle avant J.C.",,,"Vulci","42.4192224","11.6286618333","ville","Italie","certain",,,,"British Museum","1837","Londres",,"Royaume-Uni","51.519533","-0.127000","batiment","http://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/003144767","1"

"80288","2","Amphore à col attique à figures rouges","Cette amphore est décoré de deux scènes opposées, dont les inscriptions désignent les protagonistes. Sur la première face, agitée, trois personnages mythologiques : Hippolyte, la reine des Amazones, combat, lance en main et à cheval, Thésée, le héros athénien. Derrière elle se trouve Deinomaché, une autre Amazone, qui décoche une flèche. Au revers, une scène calme avec trois humains : une jeune femme à gauche, Phylonoé, un jeune homme au centre, Politès, et face à lui une autre jeune femme, aussi appelée Deinomaché, lui présentant une phiale. L'homonymie entre l'Amazone et la jeune femme est sans doute la clé de l'interprétation de ce vase qui a fait couler beaucoup d'encre. Ce vase était considéré par Millin comme le « roi de la galerie » du comte Pourtalès.","Découvrez l'histoire de ce vase qui a traversé les siècles depuis sa création en Attique (Grèce) jusqu'au Musée Condé de Chantilly.","Cette amphore a été découverte dans un tombeau lors des fouilles du marquis Vivenzio, sur ses terres près de Nola, avant 1798.","Après sa découverte, le vase a été acquis, vers 1801, par Edme Antoine Durand, qui le vend à Pourtalès en 1813. Il figure dans la vente de 1865, dont il est le vase le plus cher (pas moins de 10 100 Francs), vendu à Henri de Triqueti pour Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale, au château de Chantilly.","Le vase est conservé depuis 1865 à Chantilly, devenu le Musée Condé en 1886.",,"Explore the history of this vase throughout the centuries from its creation in Attica (Greece) during the 5th C. BC to the Musée Condé in Chantilly.","The vase was discovered before 1798 during the exacavations by Nicola Vivenzio in Nola (Italy).","After its discovery, this vase was bought by Edme Antoine Durand around 1801, and sold to the count de Pourtalès in 1813.  In the auction Pourtalès in 1865, it was bought by Henri de triqueti for Henri d'Orléans, Duc d'Aumale, in Chantilly.  ","This vase has been kept since 1865 in the Chantilly Castle, now Musée Condé, after passing into the collections of Vivenzio, Durand, Pourtalès and Duc d'Aumale.","Aison","vase","vase","Amphore","terre cuite","37 cm (hauteur)","37",,,,,,"Vers l'an 450 avant J.C.","-450",,"Nola","40.926823","14.524545","ville","Italie","incertain",,,,"Musée Condé",,"Chantilly",,"France","49.19337","2.468664","batiment","https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/00380288","0"
